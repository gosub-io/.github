# Welcome to the Gosub.io organisation.

This organisation contains all the repositories concerning the Gosub Browser engine. 


## Current status

Our main web engine can be found at [https://github.com/gosub-io/gosub-engine](https://github.com/gosub-io/gosub-engine). It's not capable of rendering most HTML sites, but it's gradually improving. Note that we are still a long way off from a decent browser so do not expect anything you can use except for testing purposes.

We will update this page later on when we have more documentation and project structure.


## How to get involved

We love contributions from everybody. Please read our [contribtion page](https://gosub.io/contribute/) to find out more.
