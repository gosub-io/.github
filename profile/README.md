# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

This repository contains all the code concerning the gosub-browser. It's not mature or even remotely capable of displaying html pages for you, but it might be someday. 


## Current status

Right now, the focus is to get a html5 tokenizer and parser up and running. This would allow us to send the parser an HTML document (or fetch it directly from the internet), which will output a document tree of tokens that make up a given webpage. That's it. It is not much, but it is still a significant part of the system. From that point, we can either do some work on fetching these HTML pages remotely or see if we can convert this document tree to a DOM tree, which would be the input for other systems like the user-agent that can render the tree onto the screen.


# 🌈 Contribution guidelines 
**How can the community get involved?**

There will be a contributing guideline soon.

# 👩‍💻 Useful resources
**Where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?**

We don't have a lot of resources. Hopefully, we will have a wiki or something with documentation about the browser.
